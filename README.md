# GAH-
The Global Advancement of Humanity

Inspired by the New Hampshire Public Radio's podcast of The Public Comment Period (Podcast on Civics 101). 

GAH! Or the “Global Advancement of Humanity” is the digital representation of “in order to succeed, we must have permission to fail.” Therefore, GAH is the embodiment of knowledge, warning signs and other implemented or academic exploration of a given policy and its outcome.
